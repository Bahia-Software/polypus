    Note on parallelism: a single Python-level Aer call holds the GIL for its
    whole duration, so dispatching circuits one-by-one (or via Python threads)
    runs them sequentially.  Instead, all circuits are submitted in a *single*
    ``AerSimulator.run`` call with ``max_parallel_experiments=0`` (use all
    available threads): Aer's C++ engine then executes the experiments in
    parallel across CPU cores while releasing the GIL.  This is the only real
    parallelism available for local simulation; true QPU parallelism across
    processes is provided by the CUNQA distributed infrastructure.
