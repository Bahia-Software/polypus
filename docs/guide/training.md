# Variational training

`polypus.train` optimizes the parameters of a variational circuit. The optimizer is the second argument; the population of each generation is distributed across the available QPUs.

```python
result = polypus.train(
    qc,  # parameterized polypus.Circuit or Qiskit QuantumCircuit
    polypus.DE(generations=100, population_size=50),
    shots=1024,
    n_qpus=1,
    dimensions=2,  # number of variational parameters
    expectation_function=cost,
    infrastructure="local",
    nodes=1,
    cores_per_qpu=1,
    id="qaoa",
    seed=42,
)
```

Optimizers **maximise** the fitness. For a minimisation problem, return the negated cost.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `qc` | Parameterized circuit: a `polypus.Circuit` with `polypus.Param(i)` angles, or a Qiskit `QuantumCircuit` |
| `method` | `polypus.DE`, `polypus.PSO`, `polypus.QNG` or `polypus.CMAES` |
| `shots` | Shots per circuit execution |
| `n_qpus` | Number of QPUs the population is spread over |
| `dimensions` | Number of variational parameters |
| `expectation_function` | The fitness: a `bitstring -> float` callable, a `polypus.CachedCost`, or a native `polypus.Qubo` / `polypus.Ising` |
| `infrastructure` | `"local"`, `"cunqa"` or `"qmio"` |
| `nodes`, `cores_per_qpu` | SLURM allocation, used by `"cunqa"` only (must be `>= 1` there) |
| `walltime` | Optional SLURM walltime of the QPUs as `HH:MM:SS` (default `"10:00:00"`), used by `"cunqa"` only |
| `id` | Run name prefix: `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`, at most 64 characters. A UUID is appended for uniqueness. |
| `backend` | `"aer"` (default) or `"polypus"` for `infrastructure="local"` |
| `seed` | Optional RNG seed. Without one, a seed is drawn from OS entropy and reported in the result. |

Ctrl+C stops the optimization promptly and raises `KeyboardInterrupt`. An exception raised by `expectation_function` propagates as itself.

## The result

`train` and `qml.train` return a `TrainResult`:

| Field | Content |
|---|---|
| `best_params` | `list[float]`, the optimized parameters |
| `best_fitness` | Fitness at those parameters |
| `iterations_run` | Iterations actually run, early stopping included |
| `converged` | Whether the convergence criterion was met |
| `seed` | The effective seed; pass it back as `seed=...` to reproduce the run |
| `id` | The effective run id |

The seed can also be pinned on the optimizer (`polypus.DE(..., seed=42)`). The `seed` argument of `train` takes precedence. On the native backend the same seed also drives shot sampling, so the whole run reproduces exactly.

## Cost functions

**Python callable.** `expectation_function(bitstring) -> float` maps one measured bitstring to its cost; Polypus weights it by the counts. Each distinct bitstring is evaluated once per batch.

**Cached callable.** `polypus.CachedCost(fn)` memoises `fn` across the whole optimization, not only within a batch. This pays off near convergence, when the population keeps producing the same bitstrings. `fn` must be pure.

**Native observables.** `polypus.Qubo` and `polypus.Ising` describe the cost as data and are evaluated in Rust, without calling Python per bitstring.

```python
# f(x) = sum_i linear_i x_i + sum_ij w_ij x_i x_j + constant, x_i in {0, 1}
cost = polypus.Qubo(
    4, linear=[(0, 1.0), (1, -2.0)], quadratic=[(0, 1, 3.0)], constant=0.5
)
cost = polypus.Qubo.from_matrix(Q)  # f(x) = x^T Q x

# f(z) = sum_i h_i z_i + sum_ij J_ij z_i z_j + constant, z_i = 1 - 2 x_i
cost = polypus.Ising(4, fields=[(0, 0.5)], couplings=[(0, 1, -1.0), (1, 2, -1.0)])
```

Both take `scale=-1.0` to turn a minimisation into a maximisation. Bit order matches Qiskit's read-out: the right-most bit is variable 0.

## Optimizers

### Differential Evolution

```python
polypus.DE(generations=100, population_size=50, tolerance=0.01, patience=20, seed=None)
```

The run stops early when the best fitness improves by less than `tolerance` over the last `patience` generations.

### Particle Swarm Optimization

```python
polypus.PSO(
    generations=100,
    population_size=50,
    bounds=(-math.pi, math.pi),
    inertia_weight=0.5,
    cognitive_weight=1.0,
    social_weight=1.0,
    tolerance=0.01,
    seed=None,
)
```

### Quantum Natural Gradient

```python
polypus.QNG(
    variance_function,
    max_iters=100,
    bounds=(-math.pi, math.pi),
    learning_rate=0.1,
    finite_difference_step=0.1,
    tikhonov_reg=0.05,
    seed=None,
)
```

`variance_function(theta, a) -> float` estimates the diagonal element of the quantum Fisher information matrix for parameter `a` at the point `theta`. [`examples/max_cut_qaoa.py`](../../examples/max_cut_qaoa.py) implements one for QAOA.

### CMA-ES

```python
polypus.CMAES(
    generations=100,
    population_size=None,
    sigma0=math.pi / 2,
    tolerance=0.01,
    patience=20,
    restarts=0,
    seed=None,
)
```

The covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (Hansen's tutorial, arXiv:1604.00772) samples each generation from a normal distribution and moves its mean, step size and covariance towards the best candidates. The mean and the samples are not limited to `[0, 2π)`, so the search can cross the seam between `2π` and `0`; each candidate is wrapped into `[0, 2π)` before it is evaluated, and `best_params` is the best wrapped candidate evaluated.

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `generations` | Total generations, over the first run and every restart. Each generation is one batch; there is no separate initial batch. At least 1 |
| `population_size` | Candidates per generation in the first run, at least 2. `None` uses Hansen's default `4 + floor(3 ln d)` for `d = dimensions` (9 for 6 parameters) |
| `sigma0` | Initial step size in radians, in `(0, 2π]`. The default `π/2` suits angles spread over the whole circle; larger values make runs stall more often |
| `tolerance`, `patience` | The run ends when its best fitness improves by less than `tolerance` over its last `patience` generations, as with DE |
| `restarts` | IPOP restarts allowed. When a run ends, the next one starts from a new random mean with twice the population |

A run also ends when its distribution degenerates: its spread collapses below `1e-12·sigma0` or grows beyond `1e4·sigma0`, its covariance becomes ill-conditioned (condition number above `1e14`), or a value is no longer finite. Either way the next restart starts if one is left; otherwise the optimisation stops with `converged=True`. If the generations run out first, `converged` is `False`. `iterations_run` counts the generations of all runs. Invalid settings raise `ValueError` when `train` starts, before any circuit runs.

**Batch size and QPUs.** Each generation is one batch of `population_size` circuits, spread over the `n_qpus` QPUs. The default population is small, which suits a few QPUs. In the prototype benchmark behind this optimizer (QAOA MaxCut, 1500 to 3000 evaluations), CMA-ES with its default population and DE with `strategy="lshade"` both beat the classic DE by 2 to 3 points of approximation ratio, while CMA-ES forced to a population of 30 lost most of that advantage: for a fixed number of evaluations, a larger population leaves fewer generations to adapt. With a budget of 500 evaluations none of them did better than the classic DE. As a rule of thumb:

- with few QPUs, use `polypus.CMAES()` with the default population;
- with many QPUs, prefer `polypus.DE(strategy="shade")`, whose population stays fixed and can match `n_qpus`, or `strategy="lshade"`, which starts with large batches and shrinks them;
- `restarts` doubles the population at each restart, so later runs fill more QPUs and explore multimodal landscapes better. All runs share `generations`, so keep `restarts` small unless `generations` is large.

If you raise `population_size`, a multiple of `n_qpus` keeps every QPU busy.

With `infrastructure="cunqa"`, the walltime warning projects the first generation over `generations`. With `restarts`, it assumes the worst case, a restart after every generation until none are left. Because the population doubles at each restart, the projection can be well above the usual run time.

**Reproducibility.** A seed reproduces a CMA-ES run exactly on the same machine and build. Across operating systems or CPU architectures it may not: CMA-ES's own steps use exponentials, logarithms and cosines from the platform's math library, whose last bit can differ, and a one-bit difference early on can lead a run to a different optimum. DE's steps use only basic arithmetic, so a DE run over a backend whose results do not depend on the platform is reproducible everywhere; the native simulator's `sin`/`cos` add the same caveat to every optimizer.
